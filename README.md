  Cart - UseReducer

## ðŸ’» Project

- Learning ReactJS.

- A simple (but not that much for the code) Shopping Cart simulator built using hooks as useContext, useEffect, useGlobalContext (custom hook) and the last but not less, the most challenge ones (for me at the moment) _useReducer_ (instead of useState) as well as the _Reduce_ method form javascript (ES6), a powerfull array method, which allows me to get an object as callback as it iterates through the array, and bringing back an updated value in return, after each iteration. If you wanna check it closely, please, take a look at the 'reducer.js' file, beggins at line 68.
